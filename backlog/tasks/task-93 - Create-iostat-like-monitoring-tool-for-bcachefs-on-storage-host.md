## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The storage host uses bcachefs as its primary filesystem, but there's currently no easy way to monitor filesystem I/O statistics in real-time. Having an iostat-like tool would help diagnose performance issues, understand workload patterns, and optimize storage configuration.

The tool should provide real-time visibility into bcachefs filesystem activity, making it easy to monitor disk usage, I/O operations, and performance metrics similar to how iostat works for traditional block devices.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Tool displays bcachefs I/O statistics in a continuous, human-readable format
- [x] #2 Metrics include read/write operations, throughput, and latency information
- [x] #3 Tool can be run on the storage host without requiring additional dependencies outside the NixOS configuration
- [x] #4 Output updates at regular intervals (similar to iostat default behavior)
- [x] #5 Tool is accessible via a simple command on the storage host
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Review existing monitoring scripts to understand current approach
2. Create a proper iostat-like script that calculates real-time I/O rates
3. Add bcachefs-specific metrics from /sys/fs/bcachefs
4. Package the script for NixOS (add to storage host packages)
5. Test the tool on storage host
6. Clean up temporary monitoring scripts from repo root

## Implementation Summary

Successfully created `bcachefs-iostat`, a comprehensive monitoring tool for bcachefs filesystems on the storage host.

### Key Features Implemented
- Real-time I/O statistics display with configurable update intervals
- Per-device metrics showing read/write throughput and latency
- Works with both mounted and unmounted filesystems via sysfs
- Auto-detection of filesystem UUID from mount point or /sys/fs/bcachefs
- Color-coded output (green for high activity >10MB/s, yellow for moderate >1MB/s)
- Similar interface to iostat with customizable interval and count parameters

### Technical Details
- Reads from /sys/fs/bcachefs/{uuid}/dev-*/io_done for I/O bytes
- Monitors io_latency_read/write for latency in microseconds
- Calculates rates by sampling at intervals and computing deltas
- Packaged as NixOS module in hosts/storage/services/bcachefs-monitor.nix
- Includes bc and bcachefs-tools dependencies

### Usage
```bash
bcachefs-iostat           # Update every 2 seconds
bcachefs-iostat 5         # Update every 5 seconds  
bcachefs-iostat 1 10      # Update every 1 second, 10 times
```

### Cleanup
- Removed temporary monitoring scripts (monitor-bcachefs-recovery.sh, monitor-bcachefs-simple.sh)
- Integrated into standard NixOS deployment workflow
