## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Finish the self-hosted Attic binary cache setup by fixing remaining issues and testing the complete workflow. The core infrastructure is deployed and running, but needs final configuration and validation.

**Background:**
- Self-hosted atticd running on storage at http://storage.bat-boa.ts.net:8080
- Magic Nix Cache configured in GitHub Actions
- System cache created with admin token
- Substituters configured in common.nix

**Current Issues:**
1. Public URL (https://attic.arsfeld.one) returns 502 Bad Gateway
2. Local auto-push workflow not tested
3. CI caching not validated
4. SQLite permissions fix needs documentation
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Fix Caddy/tsnsrv routing to make https://attic.arsfeld.one accessible
- [x] #2 Verify Attic server responds correctly at public URL
- [x] #3 Test attic watch-store for automatic local build caching
- [x] #4 Push a test build to the cache and verify it's accessible
- [x] #5 Run a GitHub Actions build and verify Magic Nix Cache works
- [x] #6 Document SQLite permissions workaround in cache.nix or CLAUDE.md
- [x] #7 Update CLAUDE.md with final Attic setup instructions
- [x] #8 Mark task-67 acceptance criteria #9 as complete

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
## Fix Applied - Attic Bind Address (2025-10-18)

Changed Attic listen address from `127.0.0.1:8080` to `0.0.0.0:8080` in `/home/arosenfeld/Code/nixos/hosts/storage/cache.nix`.

**Why this fixed the issues:**
- The Caddy/tsnsrv reverse proxy couldn't reach Attic when it was bound only to localhost
- Remote builders (cloud) couldn't access the cache directly
- Binding to 0.0.0.0 allows both local and remote access

**Verified:**
- ✅ https://attic.arsfeld.one/ returns HTTP 200 (was 502 Bad Gateway)
- ✅ Cloud can access http://storage.bat-boa.ts.net:8080/ directly
- ✅ Attic service responds with correct HTML content

**Commit:** 33c3e88 - fix: bind Attic to all interfaces for remote builder access

## All Acceptance Criteria Completed (2025-10-18)

### AC #3: Test attic watch-store ✅
- Attic client configured to use https://attic.arsfeld.one
