## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Replace the current tsnsrv-based gateway (64 separate Tailscale instances) with a single Caddy instance using the caddy-tailscale plugin.

## Context

Task-22 investigation revealed that tsnsrv creates 64 separate Tailscale nodes (one per service), consuming 60.5% CPU. The solution is to use Caddy with the Tailscale plugin, making Caddy itself a single Tailscale node that handles all services.

## Important: OAuth2 Support Required

**We need to use the fork from PR #109** which adds OAuth2 support:
https://github.com/tailscale/caddy-tailscale/pull/109

The upstream caddy-tailscale doesn't yet support OAuth2, which we need for Authelia integration. This PR adds the necessary OAuth2 authentication support.

## Solution Architecture

**Current (tsnsrv)**:
- 64 separate tsnsrv processes
- Each creates its own Tailscale node (tsnet.Server)
- Each has its own network monitor polling
- CPU: 60.5%

**New (caddy-tailscale)**:
- 1 Caddy instance with Tailscale plugin (from fork)
- Caddy joins Tailnet as a single node
- Caddy handles all reverse proxy routing
- Tailscale Funnel enabled for public access
- OAuth2 support for Authelia integration
- Expected CPU: ~2-5% (~55% reduction)

## Access Patterns

- **Tailnet users**: Connect directly to Caddy via Tailscale (fast, `<service>.bat-boa.ts.net`)
- **Public users**: Connect via Tailscale Funnel to same Caddy
- **Custom domain** (arsfeld.one): Handled by existing cloud host proxy
- **HTTPS**: Tailscale certs for .ts.net + ACME for custom domains
- **Auth**: Authelia continues as forward auth to Caddy (via OAuth2)

## Implementation Steps

1. **Package caddy-tailscale plugin from fork** (PR #109 with OAuth2 support)
   - Check if available in nixpkgs, otherwise build from fork
   - Ensure OAuth2 authentication is enabled
2. Update `modules/media/gateway.nix`:
   - Remove tsnsrv configuration (line 147)
   - Configure Caddy with Tailscale plugin
   - Add Tailscale authentication/network config
   - Configure OAuth2 integration with Authelia
3. Configure Tailscale Funnel for public access
4. Test with 2-3 services first
5. Verify both Tailnet and public access work
6. Verify Authelia OAuth2 authentication works
7. Deploy to all services
8. Monitor CPU usage to confirm reduction

## Key Changes

- `modules/media/gateway.nix`: Remove tsnsrv, add caddy-tailscale (from fork)
- Caddy config: Add Tailscale network listener with OAuth2
- Keep all existing: Authelia, service routing, CORS, error pages

## Benefits

- ✅ ~55% CPU reduction (60.5% → 2-5%)
- ✅ Fast local Tailnet access (unchanged)
- ✅ Public access via Funnel (unchanged)
- ✅ OAuth2 support for Authelia
- ✅ Simple architecture (remove tsnsrv)
- ✅ No vendor lock-in
- ✅ Unified configuration

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
## Implementation Progress - 2025-10-16

### Stage 1: Caddy Package with Tailscale Plugin - ✅ COMPLETED

**Changes Made:**
- Updated `hosts/storage/configuration.nix` to use `pkgs.caddy.withPlugins`
- Added tailscale plugin from upstream (v0.0.0-20250207163903-69a970c84556)
- Plugin hash: `sha256-v/CgwMZY8L94CWSqeR0YGjk/x7uLLG+5rlgvIhkgdzI=`
- Using upstream plugin instead of fork (PR #109 has module path issues)

**Note on OAuth Support:**
Initial task requested using erikologic/caddy-tailscale fork (PR #109) for OAuth2 support. However:
- The fork's go.mod still declares module path as github.com/tailscale/caddy-tailscale
- This causes Go build failures (module path mismatch)
- OAuth support in PR #109 is for **node registration** (ephemeral nodes), not user auth
- Using standard Tailscale auth keys instead (via TS_AUTHKEY environment variable)
- This achieves the same CPU reduction goal (60.5% → ~2-5%)

### Stage 2: Gateway Configuration - ✅ COMPLETED

**Files Modified:**

1. **modules/media/gateway.nix**:
   - Removed `services.tsnsrv.services = tsnsrvConfigs;` (line 147)
   - Added Tailscale configuration to Caddy globalConfig:
     ```nix
     tailscale {
       auth_key {$TS_AUTHKEY}
       ephemeral false
       state_dir /var/lib/caddy/tailscale
     }
     ```
   - Configured systemd service environment:
     - Added `EnvironmentFile` pointing to `age.secrets.tailscale-env.path`
     - Added `StateDirectory` for Tailscale state

2. **modules/media/__utils.nix**:
   - No changes needed to `generateHost` function
   - Virtual hosts work as-is (service.arsfeld.one)

**Architecture:**
- **Before**: 64 tsnsrv processes, each creating separate Tailscale node
- **After**: 1 Caddy instance with Tailscale plugin, single Tailscale node
- Services remain accessible at `<service>.arsfeld.one`
- Caddy joins Tailnet as single node ("storage" or auto-generated)

**Build Verification:**
- ✅ Configuration builds successfully
- ✅ Caddy package includes tailscale plugin
- ✅ Caddyfile generated with correct Tailscale configuration
- ✅ All 64 service virtualHosts preserved

### Next Steps (Deployment & Testing)

**IMPORTANT**: This implementation is ready but NOT yet deployed. Next steps:

1. **Enable Tailscale Funnel** (Stage 3):
   - Need to configure Funnel on the Tailscale node via admin console or CLI
   - Command: `tailscale funnel --bg --https=443 storage`
   - Or configure via Tailscale admin console ACLs

2. **Test Deployment** (Stage 3):
   - Deploy to storage host: `just deploy storage`
   - Verify Caddy starts and joins Tailnet
   - Test 2-3 services first (jellyfin, sonarr, radarr)
   - Verify Authelia forward auth still works

3. **Monitor CPU Usage** (Stage 4):
   - Measure CPU before: ~60.5%
   - Measure CPU after: Expected ~2-5%
   - Monitor for 24-48 hours for stability

4. **Potential Issues to Watch**:
   - Tailscale auth key validity (ensure it's not expired)
   - Funnel configuration for public access
   - Service accessibility from both Tailnet and public
   - Authelia authentication flow

### Files Modified Summary
- `hosts/storage/configuration.nix` (Caddy package with plugin)
- `modules/media/gateway.nix` (Tailscale config, removed tsnsrv)
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (created for tracking)

### Rollback Plan
If issues occur:
1. Restore `services.tsnsrv.services = tsnsrvConfigs;` in gateway.nix
2. Remove Caddy Tailscale configuration
3. Revert to stock Caddy package
4. Redeploy: `just deploy storage`
