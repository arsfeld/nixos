Git commit messages follow the angular way, with emojis for the type

Here's the complete list of emoji types for Angular-style git commits:

| Type | Emoji | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| feat | ✨ | A new feature |
| fix | 🐛 | A bug fix |
| docs | 📚 | Documentation changes |
| style | 💎 | Changes that don't affect code (formatting, missing semi-colons, etc) |
| refactor | 📦 | Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| perf | 🚀 | Performance improvements |
| test | 🧪 | Adding missing or correcting existing tests |
| build | 🛠️ | Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies |
| ci | 👷 | Changes to CI configuration files and scripts |
| chore | 🧹 | Other changes that don't modify src or test files |
| revert | ⏪ | Reverts a previous commit |

Example of usage: `git commit -m "✨ feat: add new login feature"`
