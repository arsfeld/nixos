This application would be kind of an script intrepeter, but without writing the script. So, as years went by, I never implemented my idea but I always found something that could be solved by my application or something that resembled it.

To be honest I was creating scripts for that for a while, but running scripts in the terminal is boring. Eventually that led me to improve the Rhythmbox dataprovider, then the iPod and media classes in Conduit as part of Google Summer of Code 2008 and then I couldn&#8217;t stop having ideas for Conduit.

Some corner cases are still unresolved, such as our custom version of the Google library not loading everytime or the possibility of the iPod dataprovider not showing if you install the GPod library after starting Conduit for the first time (I could say &#8220;Who would do that?&#8221;, but I do sometimes 😉 I&#8217;ll probably disable the cache on these cases.</p>\\n<p>Another thing I just implemented is the ability to save and restore everything from GConf, while we only used GConf for window settings before and kept all syncset information in a XML format.

But I didn&#8217;t really liked the reasons I did so.</p>\\n<p>First, I love Arch Linux. It&#8217;s simplicity and speed are amazing. It&#8217;s clearly focused on power users, which is great for me. It&#8217;s package manager (Pacman) is very fast and powerful, while still easy to use. I love how I can search and query packages both installed and from the cache with concise commands that usually do what you want at the first time. Compared to Ubuntu&#8217;s apt-cache and apt-get, which I usually have to read the man page to remember a few commands and to Fedora&#8217;s yum, which I&#8217;m never comfortable with, Pacman is always the winner. If that was not enough, you can create useful packages in under 10 minutes. Better yet if you can find a pre-made PKGBUILD in AUR, which contains thousands of recipes to build packages. The binary packages are usually enough for a desktop, but sometimes you do need to dig into Yaourt, which automatically downloads and compiles recipes. It is time-consuming sometimes, but comparing to finding a PPA with a decent enough version of a package that you can&#8217;t find in Ubuntu, it&#8217;s not much different.</p>\\n<p>That leads to the first reason I switched away from Arch, is that Ubuntu usually has recent enough versions when it&#8217;s released. But six months afterwards, I really want to try new versions of packages. If I can find a good and well-maintained PPA, then it&#8217;s ok. If I can&#8217;t, there are a thousand other things I would like to do then to create my own packages for new upstream releases. So, this time of the year, a few weeks after Ubuntu was released, I can actually enjoy it for a while (actually, Rhythmbox is just out with a new version, which I will probably never get on this version of Ubuntu).</p>\\n<p>The second reason and one that is a hot topic right now, but this is mostly a user perspective, I got locked into the Gnome modifications that Ubuntu did. Honestly, I like the modifications, I like the Indicator applet, I&#8217;m using the Indicator Applet Menu (despite a few bugs) and I love the Notify OSD. And I miss those on Arch. I tried building some components of Ayatana Project in Arch, but didn&#8217;t had much luck (understandable actually). The Arch way is to use as much as upstream as possible without modifications, which is usually very good. You can find a few bugs which are corrected already on other distros, but you get releases faster and you get to see how upstream really is. And that is a big issue for Ubuntu, because no matter how much they talk about not forking Gnome, it&#8217;s just not upstream anymore. If I would move to Fedora or OpenSuse from Arch, I would get a very close experience. Not because they don&#8217;t improve Gnome or add their own modifications, but because all their modifications are upstream. So even on Arch, I can enjoy all the great investment these guys made to Gnome. But now I can&#8217;t use Ubuntu&#8217;s investment outside Ubuntu (I could actually if I spend enough time porting it, but it&#8217;s just not worth).</p>\\n<p>And now, I&#8217;m locked in to Ubuntu, I&#8217;m locked to the Ubuntu OS to use Ubuntu Software, which are both actually very high quality, but I&#8217;d prefer a different OS. Some other OS vendors work the same tactics to get more users and I definitely don&#8217;t want to use their software, no matter how great they are. Of course Ubuntu is miles away from these vendors, but it&#8217;s going through a similar and very dangerous path. Again, this is only a user perspective and a user that Ubuntu is not focused in (and I&#8217;m glad they have a very strong focus on other users).

But I didn’t really liked the reasons I did so.\n\n\nFirst, I love Arch Linux. It’s simplicity and speed are amazing. It’s clearly focused on power users, which is great for me. It’s package manager (Pacman) is very fast and powerful, while still easy to use. I love how I can search and query packages both installed and from the cache with concise commands that usually do what you want at the first time. Compared to Ubuntu’s apt-cache and apt-get, which I usually have to read the man page to remember a few commands and to Fedora’s yum, which I’m never comfortable with, Pacman is always the winner. If that was not enough, you can create useful packages in under 10 minutes. Better yet if you can find a pre-made PKGBUILD in AUR, which contains thousands of recipes to build packages. The binary packages are usually enough for a desktop, but sometimes you do need to dig into Yaourt, which automatically downloads and compiles recipes. It is time-consuming sometimes, but comparing to finding a PPA with a decent enough version of a package that you can’t find in Ubuntu, it’s not much different.\n\n\nThat leads to the first reason I switched away from Arch, is that Ubuntu usually has recent enough versions when it’s released. But six months afterwards, I really want to try new versions of packages. If I can find a good and well-maintained PPA, then it’s ok. If I can’t, there are a thousand other things I would like to do then to create my own packages for new upstream releases. So, this time of the year, a few weeks after Ubuntu was released, I can actually enjoy it for a while (actually, Rhythmbox is just out with a new version, which I will probably never get on this version of Ubuntu).\n\n\nThe second reason and one that is a hot topic right now, but this is mostly a user perspective, I got locked into the Gnome modifications that Ubuntu did. Honestly, I like the modifications, I like the Indicator applet, I’m using the Indicator Applet Menu (despite a few bugs) and I love the Notify OSD. And I miss those on Arch. I tried building some components of Ayatana Project in Arch, but didn’t had much luck (understandable actually). The Arch way is to use as much as upstream as possible without modifications, which is usually very good. You can find a few bugs which are corrected already on other distros, but you get releases faster and you get to see how upstream really is. And that is a big issue for Ubuntu, because no matter how much they talk about not forking Gnome, it’s just not upstream anymore. If I would move to Fedora or OpenSuse from Arch, I would get a very close experience. Not because they don’t improve Gnome or add their own modifications, but because all their modifications are upstream. So even on Arch, I can enjoy all the great investment these guys made to Gnome. But now I can’t use Ubuntu’s investment outside Ubuntu (I could actually if I spend enough time porting it, but it’s just not worth).\n\n\nAnd now, I’m locked in to Ubuntu, I’m locked to the Ubuntu OS to use Ubuntu Software, which are both actually very high quality, but I’d prefer a different OS. Some other OS vendors work the same tactics to get more users and I definitely don’t want to use their software, no matter how great they are. Of course Ubuntu is miles away from these vendors, but it’s going through a similar and very dangerous path. Again, this is only a user perspective and a user that Ubuntu is not focused in (and I’m glad they have a very strong focus on other users). I just wished Ubuntu would give a bit more back to a community it takes so much from.\n",

Yesterday I downloaded the Gnome 3 livecd but it seems my Radeon doesn’t work at all with it (all I see are some random dots in the screen even with safe mode on). Since I still wanted to test Gnome 3, I updated an Arch Linux installation I had to Gnome 3 (took a long time to download since I had tons of stuff to update). So then I was finally able to actually test Gnome 3 today. And I was quite impressed by two things.\n\n\nOne, it crashed a lot for me. Don’t know if it’s a Gnome 3 issue or an Arch Linux issue. But it crashed every 5 minutes. I couldn’t change the wallpaper without it crashing. And most of the times it wouldn’t login telling me something went wrong and I had to logout.

                        "plaintext": "From the same project as my last blog post, we had to connect a Laravel 5 web application to a SQL Server instance running on Azure. It took me awhile to get everything working well, so I want to share a few tips for anyone looking for something like that.\n\n\nA quick Google search gives lots of good resources and once you find out the SQL Server connector in Ubuntu / Linux is actually called FreeTDS or Sybase (btw, Wikipedia has a nice article about why this name), you’re good to go with a few apt-get commands if you’re on Ubuntu:\n\n\nsudo apt-get install freetds-common freetds-bin unixodbc php5-sybase\n\n\n\nGreat, but then you get this error:\n\n\nSQLSTATE[01002] Adaptive Server connection failed (severity 9)\n\n\n\nOops! This happens because we’re trying to connect to an Azure server, so you can actually ignore this if you’re not getting this error.\n\n\nSomewhere in the internet you discover you have to change the TDS protocol version to connect to Azure. Cool! You also discover you can do that in a configuration file. So, open up /etc/freetds/freetds.conf and change a few lines around:\n\n\n[global]\n        # TDS protocol version\n        ;tds version = 4.2\n        tds version = 8.0\n\n\n\nEverything is great and life can move on!\n\n\nOr, so you thought! Once you started handling dates in your models, all hell break loose and you start to get Carbon and Datetime issues everywhere. Don’t worry, the fix is simple again, now go to /etc/freetds/locales.conf and make it look like:\n\n\n[default]\ndate format = %Y-%m-%d %I:%M:%S.%z\n\n\nNow you can actually start working on something productive again!\n",
