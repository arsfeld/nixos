# About Alex Rosenfeld

I'm a software engineer passionate about infrastructure automation, self-hosting, and declarative system configuration. I maintain a fleet of 10+ NixOS machines ranging from ARM routers to x86 servers, and enjoy sharing the patterns and tools I develop to manage them effectively.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog focuses on practical, real-world solutions for:

- **NixOS Configuration Management**: Patterns like the Constellation system for managing multiple machines
- **Self-Hosted Infrastructure**: Alternatives to cloud services that you can run at home
- **Multi-Architecture Deployment**: Running services across x86 and ARM devices seamlessly
- **Declarative Operations**: Using code to define and manage infrastructure

All code examples and configurations shared here are from my actual production setup, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/arsfeld/nixos).

## Background

I've been running self-hosted infrastructure for over a decade, evolving from Docker Compose setups to Kubernetes, and finally to NixOS with custom orchestration patterns. This journey has taught me the value of declarative configuration, atomic updates, and keeping infrastructure simple enough to understand and maintain.
