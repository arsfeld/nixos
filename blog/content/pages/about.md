# About Alexandre Rosenfeld

I'm a Senior Software Architect based in Montreal, Canada, with a passion for building great teams and products. My journey in technology spans over 15 years, from contributing to open source projects as a Computer Engineering student in Brazil to architecting scalable solutions for global companies.

## Professional Journey

Currently serving as Senior Software Architect at ACCESS Newswire, I specialize in re-architecting products using microservices and modern cloud architectures. Previously, I led the Programming & DevOps team at Ubisoft, where I implemented DevOps practices and observability systems that transformed how teams deliver software.

My technical expertise spans multiple languages and frameworks - from C# and Python to Laravel and React - but my true passion lies in solving complex problems and helping teams grow.

## A Long History with Open Source

My open source journey began in 2008 as a Google Summer of Code participant, working on Conduit for the GNOME project. This experience shaped my philosophy about data ownership and interoperability - themes that still resonate in my work today. Back then, I dreamed of applications that could seamlessly share and transform data, making computers truly useful for their users.

## From Data Liberation to Self-Hosting

Over the years, my focus evolved from data interoperability to infrastructure ownership. I've been running self-hosted infrastructure for over a decade, progressing through various solutions:

- Started with simple scripts and manual configurations
- Moved to Docker Compose for containerization
- Experimented with Kubernetes for orchestration
- Finally settled on NixOS for declarative, reproducible systems

Today, I maintain a fleet of NixOS machines ranging from ARM-based routers to powerful x86 servers, all managed through declarative configuration.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog chronicles my ongoing experiments with:

- **NixOS patterns and configurations** from real production systems
- **Self-hosting solutions** as alternatives to cloud services
- **Infrastructure automation** using declarative approaches
- **Technical deep-dives** into networking, containerization, and system design

All configurations and code shared here are from my actual setup, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/arsfeld/nixos).

## Beyond Code

I speak five languages (Portuguese, English, French, Spanish, and German) and believe that effective communication is as crucial as technical skills. I'm passionate about mentoring, always learning, and helping others grow in their careers.
