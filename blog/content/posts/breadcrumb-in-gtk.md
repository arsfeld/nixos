<p>Anyone knows how to implement (or anywhere it&#8217;s implemented) a breadcrumb / pathbar like the one in Nautilus in PyGtk? I just don&#8217;t know how to hide buttons that doent fit the window.</p>
<p>By the way, anyone has seen this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php/elementary-remake?content=120287"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" title="Elementary Remake" src="http://www.gnome-look.org/CONTENT/content-pre1/120287-1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">That pathbar is gorgeous. It doesn&#8217;t look as good in action tough.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I&#8217;ve been using the smaller Nautilus with the Elementary theme and it is just beautiful (the picture is from Elementary Remake, the original theme with that pathbar).</p>
