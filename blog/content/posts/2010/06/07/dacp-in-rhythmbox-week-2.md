<p>Last week there was the <a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=566852" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inclusion of libdmapsharing</a> in Rhythmbox (by the way, for all of you alpha testing Ubuntu, DAAP isn&#8217;t working in Rhythmbox because they haven&#8217;t included libdmapsharing in Ubuntu yet). So now I&#8217;m just a git pull and git merge away from following Rhythmbox master, which makes my job much easier.</p>
<p>Last week didn&#8217;t see much work from me, I was mostly fixing some bugs and some bad decisions. But I noticed I never showed screenshots of my work here. Because I love screenshots, here they are.</p>
<p>First you open your Remote application in iPhone, iPod Touch or Android device (note that on Android there is no passcode):</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/07/2010-10-32-13.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="320" height="480"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Then in Rhythmbox, you type the passcode shown in your Remote. This allows Rhythmbox to pair with your Remote:</p>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/07/iphone.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="320" height="480"></figure><p>&#8220;DACP on Rhythmbox&#8221; will become your library&#8217;s name over time. And of course, this doesn&#8217;t fully work yet, because Rhythmbox segfaults when the iPhone tries to connect. Well, what did you expected for about two weeks of work? I was pretty excited already when I saw my iPhone on the list of devices in Rhythmbox (by the way, I think I will create a new group called Remotes, I just didn&#8217;t find out how yet).</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more later.</p>
