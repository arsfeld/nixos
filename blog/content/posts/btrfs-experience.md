title = "BTRFS Experience"
date = 2025-06-11
description = "A few month ago I was installing Ubuntu in a new machine and saw the possibility to use Btrfs as my home partition (and as I later found out, as my root partition as well). Since then Iâ€™ve been playing a little bit with it, using it as my primary filesystem both for root and home, at home and at work. But now, at least for now, this experimenting is over at my work machine, so I wanted to tell a little about my experiences with this new filesystem.
