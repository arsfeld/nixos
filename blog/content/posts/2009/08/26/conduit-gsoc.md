<p>Google Summer of Code is over and I still didnt blogged about the new interface for Conduit I wrote. Well, going back to university and doing multiple things at once can really slow things down.</p>

<p>Ok, so this is not final but I think it&#8217;s an improvement over <a href="http://conduit-project.org/attachment/wiki/Screenshots/Conduit-0.3.13-some.png?format=raw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the old UI</a>. The thing is, I was tired of owner-drawn widgets and I was tired of right-clicking things at the canvas (users didn&#8217;t even know that thing in the middle was the canvas). And the new UI gives me a reason to use all the work I did to rebuild the configuration system (see why dialogs was not enough?).</p>
<p>What I still don&#8217;t like about it, is that it&#8217;s hard to get an overview of the conduit. Sinks are usually hidden so you don&#8217;t even know they are there sometimes. I was thinking about adding a button to hide and show the configuration, but I think that is confusing and not HIG-friendly.</p>
<p>Another thing I&#8217;m unsure about is tabs. Everyone has tabs nowadays, do why not Conduit?</p>

<p>Hm, I don&#8217;t like that, it does look better but it&#8217;s rather confusing.</p>
<p>I do like design, but I&#8217;m not very good at it. Anyone interested in giving me some tips? Maybe someone could draw those Mac-looking mockups, that would be great!</p>
<p>Btw, thanks a lot John Carr and John Stowers for giving me the opportunity to work on this Summer of Code.</p>
