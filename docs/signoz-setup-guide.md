# SigNoz Setup Guide for NixOS

This guide documents the process of setting up SigNoz observability platform on NixOS without Docker.

## Overview

SigNoz is an open-source observability platform that provides distributed tracing, metrics, and logs in a single pane of glass. This guide covers setting it up natively on NixOS.

**Current Version**: v0.90.1 (updated from v0.55.0)

## Architecture

The SigNoz setup consists of:
- **ClickHouse**: Time-series database for storing traces, metrics, and logs
- **Query Service**: Go backend that handles API requests
- **Frontend**: React application for the web UI
- **OpenTelemetry Collector**: Ingests and processes telemetry data
- **Alertmanager**: Handles alerts and notifications

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed

1. **Package Definitions Created**
   - `/packages/signoz-query-service/default.nix` - Go backend service (v0.90.1, vendor hash: `sha256-HARssGBij+rFTPXmgKn7Hdb658IHE0pzFUpCW+ZhrXE=`)
   - `/packages/signoz-frontend/default.nix` - Frontend extracted from release tarball (v0.90.1)
   - `/packages/signoz-clickhouse-schema/default.nix` - Database schema initialization (v0.90.1)
   - `/packages/signoz-otel-collector/default.nix` - Currently using nixpkgs opentelemetry-collector-contrib

2. **Service Configuration**
   - `/hosts/router/services/signoz-real.nix` - Complete service configuration
   - Integrated with existing monitoring infrastructure
   - Configured to collect metrics from all Prometheus exporters
   - All packages build successfully with correct hashes

3. **Data Collection**
   - Prometheus metrics from Node Exporter, Blocky DNS, Network metrics, NAT-PMP
   - OTLP endpoints configured for traces, metrics, and logs on ports 4317/4318
   - Syslog integration ready
   - ClickHouse configured as time-series backend

4. **Package Implementation Details**
   - Query service: Uses standard buildGoModule with SQLite support
   - Frontend: Extracted from official release tarball at https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/releases/tag/v0.90.1
   - All packages updated to SigNoz v0.90.1
   - Flake overlay loading fixed using haumea with proper package lifting
   - Frontend served via custom Node.js static server with gzip support

### ⚠️ Known Issues

While all packages build successfully, there are service startup issues being debugged:

1. **ClickHouse initialization**: Empty password handling in clickhouse-client
2. **Query service**: Port 9090 conflict with Prometheus (fixed, using 9091)
3. **OTEL collector**: Invalid "compression" configuration key (fixed)

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Build Individual Packages

The packages can be built and tested individually:

```bash
# Build query service
nix-build -E 'with import <nixpkgs> {}; callPackage ./packages/signoz-query-service {}'

# Build frontend (extracts from release tarball)
nix-build -E 'with import <nixpkgs> {}; callPackage ./packages/signoz-frontend {}'

# Build ClickHouse schema
nix-build -E 'with import <nixpkgs> {}; callPackage ./packages/signoz-clickhouse-schema {}'
```

### Step 2: Deploy

Deploy using: `just deploy router`

**Important**: The frontend is extracted from the official release tarball, NOT from Docker images.

**Note**: Service startup issues are currently being debugged. The deployment will complete but some services may fail to start due to configuration issues.

### Step 3: Verify Services

Check service status:
```bash
ssh root@router.bat-boa.ts.net signoz-status
```

Test trace ingestion:
```bash
ssh root@router.bat-boa.ts.net signoz-test-trace
```

## Access Points

- **Web UI**: https://router.bat-boa.ts.net/signoz
- **Query API**: http://router-ip:8080
- **OTLP gRPC**: router-ip:4317
- **OTLP HTTP**: router-ip:4318
- **Metrics Export**: router-ip:8889

## Configuration Details

### OpenTelemetry Collector

The collector is configured to:
1. Receive OTLP data on ports 4317 (gRPC) and 4318 (HTTP)
2. Scrape Prometheus metrics from existing exporters
3. Export to ClickHouse for storage
4. Provide Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoint

### ClickHouse Schema

The schema includes:
- `signoz_traces.signoz_index_v2` - Distributed tracing data
- `signoz_metrics.samples_v4` - Time-series metrics
- `signoz_logs.logs` - Log entries

### Integration with Existing Monitoring

SigNoz runs alongside Grafana/Prometheus:
- Both systems collect from the same exporters
- Caddy provides unified routing
- Alertmanager is shared between systems

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures

If packages fail to build due to vendor issues:
1. Check the full build log: `nix log /nix/store/...failing-derivation.drv`
2. Update vendor hashes as shown above
3. For complex vendoring issues, consider using `buildGoModule` with `deleteVendor = true`

### Service Failures

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Port conflicts**: Query service uses port 9091 to avoid Prometheus conflict
2. **ClickHouse client**: Password parameter issues with empty passwords
3. **OTEL collector**: Configuration syntax must match the collector version

Check logs:
```bash
journalctl -u signoz-query -f
journalctl -u signoz-otel-collector -f
journalctl -u signoz-clickhouse-init -f
journalctl -u clickhouse -f
```

### ClickHouse Issues

If ClickHouse fails to initialize:
```bash
# Check ClickHouse logs
journalctl -u clickhouse -n 100

# Manually run schema initialization
systemctl start signoz-clickhouse-init
```

## Alternative Approaches

### Using Pre-built Binaries Only

**Note**: This setup does not use Docker. All components are native Nix packages.

### Manual Binary Installation

Not recommended as all binaries are properly packaged in Nix.

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Service Startup Issues**
   - Resolve ClickHouse client password parameter handling
   - Ensure all services start correctly
   - Test complete end-to-end functionality

2. **Production Hardening**
   - Configure ClickHouse retention policies
   - Set up backup for ClickHouse data
   - Configure proper authentication
   - Set resource limits for services

3. **Integration**
   - Configure applications to send traces to OTLP endpoints
   - Set up log forwarding from all services
   - Create custom dashboards in SigNoz

## Current Progress Summary

- ✅ Query service package complete (v0.90.1, builds successfully)
- ✅ Frontend package complete - extracted from release tarball (v0.90.1)
- ✅ ClickHouse schema package ready (v0.90.1)
