# NixOS Infrastructure Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for a personal NixOS infrastructure setup. This repository manages multiple machines using Nix Flakes, providing a declarative and reproducible system configuration.

## Overview

This infrastructure consists of:

- **9+ Systems**: Including servers, desktops, and embedded devices
- **50+ Services**: Self-hosted applications for media, development, and productivity
- **Unified Authentication**: Single sign-on across all services
- **Automated Deployment**: Using deploy-rs and GitHub Actions
- **Comprehensive Backup**: Multiple backup strategies and destinations

## Key Features

### 🏗️ Infrastructure as Code
Everything is declaratively configured using Nix, from disk partitioning to service deployment.

### 🔐 Unified Authentication
Single sign-on using LLDAP + Dex + Authelia provides secure access to all services.

### 🌐 Secure Networking
Tailscale VPN connects all hosts securely, with Caddy providing HTTPS reverse proxy.

### 📦 Container-First
Most services run in Podman containers for isolation and easy updates.

### 💾 Automated Backups
Weekly backups to multiple destinations using Rustic (Restic-compatible).

### 📊 Comprehensive Monitoring
Netdata, Grafana, and custom alerts keep track of system health.
