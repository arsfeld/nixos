# Example Tailscale environment file for Caddy OAuth integration
# 
# To create the encrypted version:
# 1. Copy the OAuth client key from your existing tailscale-key.age file
# 2. Format it as an environment variable: TS_AUTHKEY=tskey-client-xxxxx
# 3. Encrypt it using ragenix:
#    echo "TS_AUTHKEY=tskey-client-xxxxx" | ragenix -e secrets/tailscale-env.age --rules secrets/secrets.nix
#
# The OAuth client key should be the same one currently used by tsnsrv
# (the one stored in tailscale-key.age)

TS_AUTHKEY=tskey-client-YOUR-KEY-HERE
