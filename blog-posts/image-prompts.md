# AI Image Generation Prompts for Constellation Pattern Blog Post

Use these prompts with your preferred AI image generation tool (DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, etc.) to create the images referenced in the blog post.

## 1. Hero Image: `constellation-pattern-hero.png`

**Prompt:**
```
A futuristic network diagram showing interconnected nodes in the style of a constellation, representing modular infrastructure. The image should be technical but elegant, with glowing connection lines between geometric nodes. Include server rack silhouettes and network symbols. Color scheme: deep blue background with bright blue and cyan accents. Modern, clean, professional tech illustration. 16:9 aspect ratio.
```

**Alternative prompt:**
```
Abstract representation of modular infrastructure as connected building blocks or puzzle pieces floating in space, with data flow lines connecting them. Sci-fi aesthetic with holographic elements. Dark background with neon blue/cyan lighting. Professional technology illustration.
```

## 2. Problems Image: `nixos-problems.png`

**Prompt:**
```
Split-screen illustration showing "before and after" - left side shows tangled, chaotic configuration files with copy-paste symbols and red warning signs, right side shows clean, organized modular blocks with green checkmarks. Technical illustration style, representing software configuration management problems and solutions.
```

**Alternative prompt:**
```
Isometric illustration of server configurations as messy, tangled cables and duplicated server blocks on one side, versus clean, organized, modular server components on the other side. Professional tech infographic style.
```

## 3. Architecture Image: `constellation-architecture.png`

**Prompt:**
```
Clean architectural diagram showing modular components (represented as interlocking geometric shapes or building blocks) that can be combined in different ways. Include labels like "common", "media", "backup", "services". Isometric view with soft shadows. Professional software architecture diagram style with blue and white color scheme.
```

**Alternative prompt:**
```
Technical blueprint-style diagram showing how constellation modules connect and compose together. Include flowchart elements and connection arrows. Blueprint blue background with white lines and text, engineering drawing aesthetic.
```

## 4. Service Mesh Image: `service-mesh.png`

**Prompt:**
```
Network topology diagram showing multiple server nodes (labeled "storage" and "cloud") with services connecting between them through a central gateway. Include flowing data streams and connection lines. Modern network architecture visualization with dark background and bright connection lines. Professional IT infrastructure diagram.
```

**Alternative prompt:**
```
3D isometric view of a service mesh with multiple server clusters connected through a central gateway hub. Show data flowing between services with animated-style connection lines. Clean, modern tech illustration with blue and green accent colors.
```

## Image Specifications
